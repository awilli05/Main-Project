# Main-Project
This repository focuses around my three main pieces of work created with Java, HTML5, and CSS.

I am a up and comming junior programmer who dropped out of college after the first year of pursuing a mechanical engineering degree due to financial hardships. My ambition is to start from scatch with no degree or certifications and striving to learn Javascript, HTML5, and CSS through programs like frrecodecamp.org and the odin project in hopes to become a fullstack developer eventually. I hope that youll follow my jouney and work and give me your support!!!
